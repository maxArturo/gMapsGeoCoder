gMapsGeoCoder
=============

Simple python script to reach out to Google Maps API and get Lat/Long points for an array of values

You need Requests(Version >= 2.3.0, but earlier should do) for this script to work. There are many assumptions about quotes (this was done for someone using the output in Excel) that you may need to adapt for your needs.
